1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Nov 15th, 2012",5.0,1.0,"Such a GREAT teacher! One of my favorites!! It is too bad that after the class that I'm in is over he won't be teaching at ACU anymore. ACU is losing one of their best teachers. He used to preach at various churches including Highland. He is a great preacher, teacher, and all around person, really going to miss him!"
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE1,"Mar 29th, 2012",5.0,1.0,Very enthusiastic and humorous. He is very knowledgable and really gets deep into his lectures with very interesting personal anecdotes. Fairly well known all over the country and he will teach you the word of god in an interesting way. Tests aren't too bad if you read the chapter and study the reviews!
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE102,"May 4th, 2011",5.0,1.0,"Very large class, no personal attention. However, he is enthusiastic."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE102,"May 4th, 2011",5.0,1.0,"Very enthusiastic, good teacher. The only issue I had is that it is a very large class (300 students) and you get no personal attention."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE102,"Apr 13th, 2011",5.0,1.0,Had this teacher for both semesters as a freshman and he was great! He is so enthusiastic and always makes class fun! When you enter class he is always playing music and he shows a lot of video clips during his presentations making it even more enjoyable! I would highly recommend taking him for freshman year!
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Mar 30th, 2011",5.0,1.0,"Enthusiastic, and very clear teaching style. I learned the material and enjoyed it."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Mar 25th, 2011",5.0,1.0,Nothing was a surprise. You always knew what was happening. Class size is huge (300+) so no 1-on-1 w/ Cope but the TAs are very helpful!! Must have professor for Freshman Bible!!
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Dec 14th, 2010",5.0,1.0,Great teacher and a pretty easy class. Just be sure to read through the verses he mentions before the test.
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Dec 9th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"Very interesting class - take notes! and actually go to class! There isn't much interaction with Cope 1 on 1 because that all depends on your TA. Many people's satisfaction comes from whether they liked their TA or not. There aren't many grades, so each quiz counts! Recommended course!"
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Nov 11th, 2010",5.0,1.0,mike cope is a GREAT choice for a bible prof. He keeps class interesting and the tests are easy!!
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL111,"Oct 26th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"Easy class, take notes during his lectures. Gives test study guides that are very clear. Interesting material."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL105,"Apr 13th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"He's a very Godly man and the nicest professor. He truely cares about his students and his lectures are never boring. He's a ""must have"" professor."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Nov 11th, 2009",5.0,1.0,LOVE him!(:
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL104,"Mar 30th, 2007",5.0,1.0,"Had him for Acts - Revelation (Majors), which he cotaught.  He is a great teacher, very easy to talk to, and obviously loves what he's doing."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE101,"Oct 6th, 2005",5.0,1.0,No Comments
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE,"Aug 24th, 2005",5.0,1.0,"Not hard, show up to class, and you wont fail."
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",LIFETEACHING,"May 26th, 2005",5.0,1.0,an amazing man of God. I feel so priveledged to have been able to learn from him. I loved every day of class (that says a lot). Incredible teacher - take him if you can!!!!
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE,"Feb 8th, 2005",5.0,1.0,He loves what he is talking about!  I would love to take another class with him as the teacher.
1,Abilene Christian University,Mike Cope,4.5,19,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE,"Jan 3rd, 2002",5.0,1.0,Best Bible teacher ever!
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL291,"May 4th, 2020",3.0,4.0,"She really is a nice lady who loves what she does and cares about her students. But... her lectures are all over the place, pretty confusing so you kinda have to teach yourself or you will be lost when the test comes. Her tests are hard and you really have to have an understanding of the material to do well. She is retiring though."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO101,"Aug 26th, 2019",3.0,4.0,"First let me say: sweet lady. Really loves and cares for her students. Can't teach to save her life. Her lectures are practically nonsense they're so scattered. They're extremely boring and always confusing. Even the most basic, simple scientific concepts she somehow turns into brain sludge. Sweet lady. Awful teacher."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO11201,"May 8th, 2019",3.0,4.0,"For Gen Bio 1 she is a better option then Hunter or brokaw as she does trim the course down, however she uses a point system which can be a bit confusing. She's sweet and is very accessible if you need her."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL291,"Apr 29th, 2019",3.0,4.0,"She lectures every class, but just reads off of an outline that you will have access to. I had to go home and teach myself from the book because following along on an outline didn't do it for me. I did well in the class but I had to work so hard for it. If you don't work for it, you will not do well. It is not a blowoff or easy A class."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL330,"Feb 22nd, 2018",3.0,4.0,"Dr. Hernandez is a very sweet and caring professor. I had her for neurobiology and had so much fun in the class. Lectures can sometimes be confusing, but that's why it is important to keep up with the material, be engaged, ask questions, and go visit during office hours. Do that and you'll be successful!"
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL113,"May 9th, 2017",3.0,4.0,She is a very sweet and caring person but very hard to follow in class and is not very helpful in lecture. She is also very strict with the phone usage.
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL291,"May 2nd, 2016",3.0,4.0,"Dr. Hernandez is a very sweet lady but you have to give more than 100% if you want to succeed, recommend going to her study sessions and reading extra as her test cover material not covered during lecture"
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL203,"Dec 20th, 2015",3.0,4.0,"She was really sweet, but I didn't enjoy being taught like a child"
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO111,"Apr 1st, 2015",3.0,4.0,"Very unhelpful in this class. I worked my butt off and still did not do very well. Tried talking to her on a regular basis to try and improve, and she was little to no help. She was very difficult to follow on lecture, and usually jumped around to where I couldn't follow her at all. The tests seemed to cover a lot of material not covered in class."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO11201,"Mar 25th, 2015",3.0,4.0,"Her lectures are all over the place. She pretty much requires you to go to the study session that take place right after chapel. If you don't go you will actually miss stuff we didn't go over in class. She gives lots of extra credit, but if you don't do it she won't help you."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Feb 5th, 2015",3.0,4.0,She wonders around in her lectures.
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Jan 5th, 2015",3.0,4.0,"She's a sweet lady, but not a great teacher. Her lectures were all over the place and confusing. She has a heart of gold, but this class is tough."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,10939,"Oct 29th, 2014",3.0,4.0,"Dr. Hernandez is a great teacher. The quizzes aren't hard if you study, and there's not much to study. She is also great mentor that is there for you. Plus, she's the only bio professor with study sessions. (Well that's what I heard from my Academic Advisor) I recommend you take her class. Lectures are 50 minutes long. Has some long Powerpoints."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Oct 13th, 2014",3.0,4.0,"Prof. Hernandez teaches straight from the powerpoint, jumps around and tends to be unclear & is very tough on cell phone use in class.."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL246,"Dec 7th, 2012",3.0,4.0,"I had her for anatomy and physiology I for nursing. Anatomy is hard, but Dr. Hernandez is the best educaor for such a difficult class. While class gets confusing a lot of the time, Dr. Hernandez is the most helpful professor that I have ever had. She will literally spend an hour explaining one concept to you until you unerstand it.an amazing woman!"
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO101,"Nov 14th, 2012",3.0,4.0,Very sweet lady...horrible professor. Tests/quizzes are very difficult with not much cohesive material to study from. I will say she makes herself available for help sometimes. Try not to take her if you can avoid it.
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO111,"Jun 6th, 2011",3.0,4.0,SHE WAS AWFUL! I could not stand her!  She is the reason I quit nursing.  I needed a B in the class and had a 78... she would not let me do anything to make up.  Her tests were so hard.  I studied every single day.  She is confusing.  She confuses herself alot. She does not know what she is talking about. dont take her
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIO120,"Aug 22nd, 2009",3.0,4.0,This was the MOST AWFUL bio class I have ever taken! With probably one of the most awful professors!
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Oct 31st, 2007",3.0,4.0,"Her class was hard because of volume of information, and she doesn't really explain anything well, so you have to learn it from the book on your own. You also have a test every friday no matter what, which stinks."
1,Abilene Christian University,Pat Hernandez,2.7,20,Biology,GENBIO,"Mar 26th, 2007",3.0,4.0,You have a quiz and a test basically every week and it gets to a point where it takes away from your other classes. Always says you need to know this on the test and it never shows up; puts questions that have little importance. It also felt like half of the semester was on plants. Mid-term and final are thirty-four percent of your final grade.
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Jun 18th, 2018",2.0,5.0,"Dr. Nichols will call on you in class without you raising your hand and sometimes if you dont know the answer well, he can come across arrogant but its just how he is. You have two tests in the class and weekly quizzes. Study the lecture material and the book, know your stuff especially if you are not a pre-med or biology major."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL492,"Feb 22nd, 2018",2.0,5.0,"Dr. Nichols is an incredible professor. I was nervous to take him, but I'm so thankful I did because I always looked forward to class with him. His passion for the subject was obvious and he did an amazing job explaining the material thoroughly. He also always had life lessons, stories, and spiritual mentoring for us which I really appreciated."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL492,"Feb 2nd, 2017",2.0,5.0,"Dr. Nichols is one of the best professors at ACU. He genuinely cares about his students. However, his class will no doubt make you work extremely hard for an A or B. He doesn't do this out of meanness, but wants to know future scientists, doctors, etc. had to put in effort for their career. I took 2 of his classes to help prepare me for med school."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO101,"May 14th, 2016",2.0,5.0,"Decent guy, horrible professors. If you think the previous writers were over exaggerating, think again. Even for the most diligent student, his classes are outrageous. Do not take him for a short course. He purposefully makes the class difficult for non-majors. For all 12 days of the short course, you will have a test. Avoid at all costs."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL492,"May 7th, 2016",2.0,5.0,"The best biology professor I've ever had at ACU. He is a phenomenal teacher and man of character.  Don't get me wrong - his class is hard! Many 4 am study mornings... BUT. You will learn so, so much. If you are preparing for med school, I absolutely recommend him. Take good notes and study consistently, and you will come away with so much. Great!!!"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL492,"Apr 14th, 2015",2.0,5.0,"Exams are extremely difficult, inconsistent grading. Sometimes gives partial credit, sometimes doesn't even for the same question on same exam. If you ask for help, he tells you to go over the material again or change your study habits. My final average was 79.8 and he refused to bump me to a B, even though I missed 0 days of class and worked hard"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,10102,"Nov 19th, 2014",2.0,5.0,Dr. Nichols is the nicest man there is but he makes you work for that grade!! He has a wonderful sense of humor but you have to make sure that you are there in class and you take notes!!!! I would recommend him!!
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO101,"Dec 17th, 2013",2.0,5.0,"You have to pay attention in this class and take good notes. Especially if you want a B or above. Put down the iPad, pay attention and take detailed notes. I recommend typing them. He is so kind, but a hard teacher."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO101,"Dec 12th, 2013",2.0,5.0,"He was a nice guy, but horrible teacher! He was not helpful at ALL. If you are good at learning material on your own you will do fine. If you actually want a lecture or need help he is definitely not the teacher for you. If you have this class switch ASAP or good luck."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO101,"Oct 28th, 2013",2.0,5.0,"This class is super frustrating and very hard. He is not willing to work with you, jumps around from different topics in his lectures making it confusing, and gives a quiz every week. If you ask for help all says is change your study habits or read the book. Not willing to work with or help you what so ever. He's a great person but HORRIBLE teacher"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOLCELL,"Sep 13th, 2011",2.0,5.0,"I had Dr. Nichols for Cell Biology and found that he is a really good teacher.  However, a lot of people don't like his testing technique because you really have to stay on top of the material.  The only grades you receive are pop quizzes, so you have to be ready everyday.  However, he is a great teacher and overall a great guy.  Take his class!"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL492,"Feb 1st, 2010",2.0,5.0,"Dr. Nichols is brilliant but his classes are ridiculous. He's funny and entertaining during class and you do learn a lot, but the exams are horrible. If he's your only option...good luck."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,CELLBIOL,"May 7th, 2009",2.0,5.0,I'll never take a class with this teacher again. You have to study the notes and reading assignments before EVERY class period in case there is a pop quiz. He is a very picky grader and its hard to figure out what he expects. He teaches as though everyone already knows the subject. Almost half the class dropped by the end. Good luck if you take him
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL312,"Apr 30th, 2008",2.0,5.0,"In his classes, it is extremely hard to tell what to study. He is a nice guy, but his classes are HARD!"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL112,"Sep 9th, 2006",2.0,5.0,Highly intelligent and highly recommended.  He makes fundamental concepts of biology easy to understand.  His class isn't a walk in the park but he makes himself available for questions. A+
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO45763,"Mar 2nd, 2006",2.0,5.0,"His Physiology class was exceptional. The best upper bio class I have had yet. He lectured clearly and if you are diligent and work hard, you can learn a lot. I feel like i learned more from that class than all other bio's ive had. Great teacher, great role model, smart dude!"
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOL,"Jan 5th, 2006",2.0,5.0,Nice guy and fun. But teaches like you know the material already and is prone to randomness. Its never clear which material you should know for the course. Bizarre grading system which left me frustrated especially when I know I studied. Unfortunately had to take 2 classes with him.
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO112,"Nov 18th, 2005",2.0,5.0,This man is very intelligent and a great person.  My fondest memory was the time he took us to Harold's.
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIO112,"Jul 9th, 2005",2.0,5.0,"is pretty unclear on what you need to know, and then grades ridiculously hard. just getting the general concept DOES NOT get you ANYWHERE in his class. but, he's pretty fun and is a great person, he just expects everyone to be insanely intelligent and completely devoted to biology. which i, for one, was not and therefore failed the class."
1,Abilene Christian University,James Nichols,3.1,20,Biology,BIOLOGY,"Mar 11th, 2004",2.0,5.0,"Prepare to work hard, but if you are serious about wanting to learn things that will help you for professional school (M.D., D.D.S.) then use this guy as much as you can."
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH120,"May 3rd, 2012",5.0,2.0,"She is a great teacher for this class. The first half is awful and useless, but she has to teach it for the university wide Math 120 test. The second half is quasi enjoyable and you will learn something about savings and the like. Great teacher who truly loves her students, sad to see her retire from ACU."
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH237,"Dec 8th, 2011",5.0,2.0,"She's really good at teaching the material but can get confusing at times. She works until you understand it though which is nice. She's kinda annoying though and constantly talks about her grandson. Compared to my other math teachers I've had, I've liked her the best."
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH120,"Nov 2nd, 2011",5.0,2.0,"Dr. Williams seems to get distracted a lot. It feels like at times she forgets what she was saying. Overall though, it's been a fairly easy class."
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH120,"Oct 13th, 2011",5.0,2.0,"She always makes mistakes when teaching so following gets really confusing. She is not good at explaining things. She never tells why, just how. So you dont actually learn anything, just memorize. This class was pointless and a waste of time and money."
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH118,"Sep 29th, 2003",5.0,2.0,She was awesome!  She made sure each of us got it and worked with us until we did.
1,Abilene Christian University,Carol Williams,3.8,6,Mathematics,MATH118,"Jul 28th, 2003",5.0,2.0,She seemed a little distracted but she was very clear and enthusiastic.
1,Abilene Christian University,Stephen Johnson,3.5,5,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",REL209,"Dec 17th, 2010",4.0,1.0,hes nice but blabbers
1,Abilene Christian University,Stephen Johnson,3.5,5,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL102,"Aug 16th, 2010",4.0,1.0,"Amazing professor. He is wonderful with words and extremely intelligent. He might be hard to get a hold of, but that is because he has an amazing family that he loves very much. Defiantly not flacky. He cares a lot about what he is teaching and has spent a lot of time learning about what he is teaching us. I praise him for his excellent work not only in the classroom but in all things he does. I would defiantly take him again and would suggest him to all my friends."
1,Abilene Christian University,Stephen Johnson,3.5,5,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL102,"Mar 26th, 2009",4.0,1.0,"A challenging professor who likes to involve the class in thought-provoking discussions. Loved him for Acts-Revelation, hope to take him again for another class."
1,Abilene Christian University,Stephen Johnson,3.5,5,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBL101,"Jan 9th, 2009",4.0,1.0,"I agree with the other rating. He is a nice person, but not a good professor. His lectures are difficult to follow. You have to write down every little thing just in case it might be on the exam. I REALLY struggled to pull out an A at the very end. He is not easy to get a hold of either."
1,Abilene Christian University,Stephen Johnson,3.5,5,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",LIFETEACHING,"Apr 18th, 2006",4.0,1.0,"My only B in college career was in this class. His lectures are very flaky and it is difficult to tell what is important and what is not. He writes nothing down. Everything on the tests is ""in your notes"" that you will have if you tape record every lecture. He is a nice man but definately not what you are looking for if you want and ""Easy A"""
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST000,"Jan 11th, 2012",2.5,4.0,Interesting class that was quite difficult
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST222,"Nov 30th, 2011",2.5,4.0,"I was not impressed by this teacher. The tests are essay and are graded hard. I always disagreed with the grades I received in the class. Often said things in class which I felt were racially and socially demeaning. In the end, I was forced to appeal my grade because, for a survey level course, he was much too picky and vague on his grading."
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST212,"Oct 20th, 2011",2.5,4.0,"Doesn't use book at all in class.  He has you read it outside of class.  Quizzes are from his vocab terms most are not highlighted in book.  All he does is lecture, and he want specific notes taken in his class.  All test are essay form."
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST221,"Mar 29th, 2011",2.5,4.0,Very repetitive with his lectures that are boring. He doesn't check attendance but you will need lecture notes for tests.
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST221,"Nov 19th, 2008",2.5,4.0,He is very hard and makes you right a lot about his lectures. His tests are all essay and not over the book it is over his lecture. I'm not sure what he really wants on his test and I am leaving his class feeling very discouraged. I learned a lot but it wasnt fun at all. I dreaded the class. He is a nice man if you get a chance to talk to him.
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HISTORY,"Aug 28th, 2008",2.5,4.0,Professor Bailey is very smart but very confusing. His projects require a lot of work.
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST101,"Jun 30th, 2008",2.5,4.0,This is one of those courses that I have found  myself quoting from him over and over.  He has made a remarkable impression on my brain and instilled a quest in me to learn more and  a desire to set the record straight.
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST210,"Dec 11th, 2006",2.5,4.0,"Great teacher, hard but you learn WHAT I WANT MORE FROM MY TEACHERS AT ACU"
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,CIVILWARETC,"Jan 1st, 2006",2.5,4.0,"People told me he was hard, and he was, but his classes were the FIRST and ONLY classes I had at ACU that I enjoyed, felt like I was really learning from, and actually retained knowledge from afterwards (I graduated 3 yrs. ago). I would audit any of his class again now if I could..."
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HIST22202,"Sep 5th, 2005",2.5,4.0,"He is very extreme and can say some things that perhaps might make you feel uncomfortable.  Hes a little crazy to say the least at times.  You have a final project that requires ALOT of research, esp on microfilm.  He is brilliant though, and has MUCH to offer on history in the deep south and how they ""combined thier racism with thier religion."""
1,Abilene Christian University,Fred Bailey,3.4,17,History,HISTOFENGLAN,"Aug 2nd, 2005",2.5,4.0,"My husband and I went to Oxford in the Maymester with Fred Bailey and we had a blast.  It's a lot of walking, but it was definitely fun.  There's a lot of ""busy work"" before and after the class, but it's not too bad and the class was a lot of fun.

He passes out cookies in the bible building to everyone! Tests are hard, mostly fill in the blank and essay but I think that is because of the TA. He works with you though so you don't get left behind. He expects a hug everytime you see him so be prepared. Heart of gold."

Don't take him if you're one of us at ACU who didn't grow up Christian. You will fail."

1,Abilene Christian University,Jason Holland,4.6,13,Mathematics,MATH185,"May 7th, 2014",4.5,2.0,Fantastic professor who is available and more than willing to help clarify confusing topics. Looks out for the struggling student while still making sure to interest the math whiz. Homework can take a large amount of time and tests are only 10 questions so watch out for careless errors. An overall quality class with an entertaining professor.

Holland has a way of getting concepts across unlike any professor I've met.

1,Abilene Christian University,Dickie Hill,2.5,17,Exercise Science & Health,PE101,"Feb 9th, 2017",1.0,5.0,His name perfectly suits him. Made us take a page of notes back and front single spaced for a fresman class. What a waste of time.
1,Abilene Christian University,Dickie Hill,2.5,17,Exercise Science & Health,PEAC216,"Dec 7th, 2016",1.0,5.0,I took walking for fitness for an easy A and pe credit. You have to show up because his attendance policy is super strict. And you have to read the textbook (yes there is a textbook for walking for fitness it is quite comical) or else you won't pass the daily quizzes. He is a sensible guy and really wants you to grow physically and spiritually.
1,Abilene Christian University,Dickie Hill,2.5,17,Exercise Science & Health,PEAC217,"May 2nd, 2016",1.0,5.0,Nice guy. Learned a little bit. Tests were tough. Recommend pass/fail class.

Entire class is busy work and he doesn't care about you or your grade. Final is 25 fill in the blank questions over 9 chapters of the most detailed things he could find.

Quiz over each chapter every class period except for the first couple of weeks,have to take 2 pages of notes and write a half page in your journal (leaves 5-10min for that at the end of the class) per class period. You will have to do a 10min presentation on a disease and a 5min presentation on a health app. Plenty of easy extra credit."

Follows his schedule on his syllabus to a T. If you read the chapters you will do just fine on the quizzes. You have to write a journal and 2 pages of notes a day for a grade.

We seriously had one test which was the final. We had a ton of quizzes but they didn't count for much. I had to read over four months of notes to look over for the final. No review or anything...

1,Abilene Christian University,Robert McKelvain,3.3,19,Psychology,SPORTPSYCH,"Apr 21st, 2014",3.0,3.0,I took sport psychology and cognition and learning with him. I earned an A in both classes. I enjoyed him very much as a teacher because with his style of teaching you have to actually learn and know the material.

I am a man so i will not grade his hotness, neither any of his students. He is a very proffesional man and deserves every bit of what he has earned in life. It is because of him that i dropped out of school, not because his class was so hard. To be a family man."

When you ask her a question or question her work, she looks at you like you are crazy or dumb. She rarely teaches us how to actually work a problem; it is mostly if you can put it in the calculator the correct way. Avoid taking her at all costs!"

You are in college, you should be prepared for that.  You WILL learn a lot in this course and it is very well worth taking if you take pride in receiving a good education."
1,Abilene Christian University,Vickie Smith,3.5,12,English,ENGL112,"May 7th, 2009",3.0,3.0,"One of the worst classes I have ever taken. Her major paper at the end of the semester required a ridiculous amount of work, for an unnecessary and useless paper. She prides herself on being a challenging teacher, but not for the sake of pushing students to your their potential. It's just so she can boost her own ego. Do NOT take her class."

1,Abilene Christian University,Sandra Willis,4.8,3,Art & Design,ARTC487,"May 6th, 2004",5.0,3.0,Education majors are actually lucky that they have no choice but to take her; she is an excellent instructor who provides a fair measure of ideas to use in the classroom.  She's pretty cool.

1,Abilene Christian University,Terry Brown,4.6,8,"Bible, Missions & Ministry",BIBLE102,"Apr 1st, 2010",5.0,1.0,TERRY BROWN IS HILARIOUS! very chill and makes the reading fun. If you take his notes you'll ACE every test. Best Prof. hands down :] Truly wished he taught more classes.

He is such a funny guy and nice guy!! And the outside reading you have to do for his classes (Life and Teachings and Acts-Revelation) are both easy and are great books! The tests aren't difficult and are directly from the notes. I had a wonderful experience!!"

Hi slife and teachings class is great, and his Acts-Rev class is awesome too. His tests can be long, but aren't too difficult. He is truly a great man! He deserves a big raise!"
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE101,"Jan 26th, 2023",5.0,1.0,I loved having Dr. Shilcutt for cornerstone because of how deeply she cared for each of her students. She also had us over to her house several times throughout the semester and was a very gracious host. I am so thankful to have had her!
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Mar 13th, 2017",5.0,1.0,A good teacher for History Majors.
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Jan 6th, 2017",5.0,1.0,"She's kind of weird but one of the sweetest professors I've had to date. She really takes an interest in getting to know her students personally. When it comes to work, she can be a tough grader and sometimes understanding the assignments takes time but she's willing to provide guidance through each step of the way."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,HIST352,"Dec 9th, 2016",5.0,1.0,Some of the hardest classes I took because she takes the time to discover your potential. She puts incredibly hard work into making each class unique and inspiring. Your life will also be consumed with work. One of my best experiences at ACU.
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,HIST353,"Nov 3rd, 2016",5.0,1.0,"Dr. Shilcutt is one of the best teachers I have had at ACU. She expects a lot of her students, especially her history majors, but she will not let you fail if you work hard. She has pushed me to be a better student and I learned a lot in her class."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,HIST211,"Sep 29th, 2016",5.0,1.0,"Dr. Shilcutt is honestly the best history instructor I have ever had. Everyone knows the basics of American history, and it's always been taught to me as date, name, etc., but Dr. Shilcutt connected these things and makes it a story. We take quizzes over chapters, doc analysis once a week and the final is open note. She is happy to help you."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE240,"Mar 6th, 2013",5.0,1.0,"Do not take her core 240 class. The class lasts three hours and if they catch you with your cellpohoneyo permanently lose 33% of your participation grade. Class is unnecessarily, assignments are cumbersome and are graded harshly. Terrible quality class. Takes the joy out of learning."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Sep 13th, 2011",5.0,1.0,"I had Dr. Shilcutt for my first semester of Core, and it was very tough.  The workload is pretty intense, and it seems like something was always due.  However, she is a great lady and cares for her students.  I would advise taking here if you don't mind the heavy workload."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE120,"Jun 8th, 2011",5.0,1.0,"Great class, so helpful"
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE120,"Apr 25th, 2011",5.0,1.0,She is an impossible to please cornerstone teacher. Her assignments were vague at best. Discussion was stifled instead of encouraged. She assigned a lot of busy work and consequently the class is a lot of work that you do not learn anything from. Do no take her for Core unless you want to work your tail off and lower your GPA.
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Dec 17th, 2010",5.0,1.0,Good teacher
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Dec 17th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"Dr. Shilcutt did the best in teaching what she had to. She really does care about her students and she is very knowledgable. This was a interestingly difficult course overall, but in the end it was thought provoking. I appreciated her honesty and teaching."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Oct 31st, 2010",5.0,1.0,"Very nice teacher, but she is not easy for Cornerstone. She seems to assign a blanket grade for every assignment, which is usually a high B or low A. The class is mostly spent talking, or discussing the topic. She's an excellent teacher, but this class (Regardless of teacher) is just stupid. The entire course gets a poor review."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE101,"Oct 30th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"""Greetings"" It seems like she is knowledgeable, but she absolutely sucks as a cornerstone teacher. It is my least favorite class ever. She grades very biased. The only good thing about the class is the other students."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Oct 30th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"Dr. Shillcut is quite literally a contender for the worst core teacher in America.  We do nothing in class, all our projects are due a week before anyone else, and your grades are arbitrary.  No matter how hard you work you can only get a 92.    Unless you are a female in which case you can do half the work and get twice the grade.  She grades your paper based on how close you are to her opinion so if you are an individual and have your own opinion you are sol for an A."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,CORE110,"Oct 18th, 2010",5.0,1.0,"She is probably a great history teacher, but she is an awful cornerstone teacher."

1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,HIST222,"Apr 5th, 2008",5.0,1.0,"One of the best teachers I have ever had! Intelligent and very helpful, makes class interesting. The ""team"" format was amazing for me and I got to know some great people by working with them all semester. Take any class that she is teaching and you won't regret it. Only drawback is if you don't like to read be wary- a lot of reading each week."
1,Abilene Christian University,Tracy Shilcutt,3.9,20,History,HIST481,"Feb 14th, 2008",5.0,1.0,"Took her for a class in Colonial America.  Very intelligent, very helpful, very challenging in the  reading and the research."

1,Abilene Christian University,Dana McMichael,3.9,7,English,LIT2,"Mar 23rd, 2016",4.5,2.0,"I've taken her classes at OC a few times. Not the most exciting, but always willing to listen to questions. Pretty clear grader and great person. Do the work, ask for help, and you will make a good grade. Always answers her emails too."
1,Abilene Christian University,Dana McMichael,3.9,7,English,ENG362,"Dec 1st, 2014",4.5,2.0,"Not the most interesting, and tends to spend a lot of time asking for student opinions or reading the texts aloud. The course was a little light on illuminating teaching. All the same, she grades fairly and seems to be quite a nice person."

1,Abilene Christian University,Dana McMichael,3.9,7,English,ENG262,"Apr 26th, 2005",4.5,2.0,Very biased in her thinking and through literature selection and assignments tries to impose her views on students. Upset me almost everyday in class. NEVER take her course.
1,Abilene Christian University,Dana McMichael,3.9,7,English,ENG362,"Oct 18th, 2004",4.5,2.0,"Great teacher, very bright, knowledgeable and friendly. Makes one work to get an A however, especially in the 111 and 112 courses."
1,Abilene Christian University,Dana McMichael,3.9,7,English,ENGL262,"Jun 26th, 2004",4.5,2.0,She's a sweet lady that seems to love what she does.  She is easy to get along with and grades rather easily.
